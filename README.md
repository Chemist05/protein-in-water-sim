# protein-in-water-sim
With this bash script you can automate the process for the simulation if you fulfill the condition.

Conditions:
- you have Gromacs
- you have Linux or a Mac / Window Subsystem for Linux
- you have at least 8GB memory
- you have a molecular visualization program

If the program spits out a lot of erros then the reason is written in the first error. 

Common reasons are:
- residue ' ' not found in residue topology database
- missing atom
- out of memory killer

Unfortunately, there is no “solution for everything” but after an error there is always a link from gromacs documentation. There you can find solutions for your problem.
